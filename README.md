Siegfried is a signature-based file identification tool.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richardlehane/siegfried.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richardlehane/siegfried)

## Version

0.1

## Install

With go installed: 

    go get github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/cmd/siegfried

    go get github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/cmd/rd2d

Or download a pre-built package:

- [Windows (64)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48160346/Releases/Win64/Siegfried_Win64_0_1.zip)

- [OSX (64)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48160346/Releases/Darwin/Siegfried_OSX64_0_1.zip)

- [Linux (64)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48160346/Releases/Linux/Siegfried_Linux64_0_1.zip)

### Signature file

To run Siegfried, you need to have an up-to-date signature file (for a description of the Siegfried signature format, see [this wiki page](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/wiki/Siegfried-signature-format)).

The pre-built packages come with a signature file (pronom.gob) built from Droid v73 signatures. Keep this file in the same directory that you run Siegfried from.

You can also build your own signature file using the R2D2 tool (it talks to Droid, get it!... and, yes, a protocol droid would have been more appropriate but that name was already taken :().

To do this:

- get recent Droid signature and container files. These are available for download from this page: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/aboutapps/pronom/droid-signature-files.html](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/aboutapps/pronom/droid-signature-files.html). If these aren't the same as the defaults in the R2D2 tool (use the r2d2 -defaults command to check), you will need to supply the names of your updated files with additional flags to the relevant R2D2 commands

- harvest Pronom reports with R2D2 (./r2d2 -harvest)

- run the R2D2 build command (./r2d2 -build)

## Usage

### Command line

    ./siegfried file.ext
    ./siegfried /DIR

    ./r2d2 -harvest
    ./r2d2 -build 
    ./r2d2 -stats
    ./r2d2 -printdroid
    ./r2d2 -defaults

- [Pronom package](http://godoc.org/github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/pkg/pronom)

## Roadmap

### Version 0.2 (March 2014)

- begin optimising. e.g. replace stop the world, full buffer, recursive frame matching with goroutines, channels and limited buffers
- implement an Identifier type that controls the matching process and stops on best possible match (i.e. no longer require a full file scan for all files)
- name/extension matching

### Version 0.3 (April 2014)

- container matching (see github.com/richardlehane/mscfb)

### Version 0.4 (May 2014)

- server mode

### Version 0.5 (July 2014)

- HTML GUI

## Changes

### Version 0.1 (28/02/2014)

First release. Parses PRONOM signatures and performs byte matching. Bare bones CLI. Glacially slow!
