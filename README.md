# Siegfried

Siegfried is a signature-based file identification tool.

## Version

0.2

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/richardlehane/siegfried.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/richardlehane/siegfried)

## Usage

### Command line

    ./sieg file.ext
    ./sieg /DIR

![Usage](usage.gif)

## Install

With go installed: 

    go get github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/cmd/sieg

Or download a pre-built binary and signature file from the [releases page](https://github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/releases/tag/v0.2).

Binaries for 64-bit Windows, OSX and Linux are available. Copy the binary to any location you like (preferably in your system's path).

The signature file (pronom.gob) should be copied to a "siegfried" directory within your computer's home directory (e.g. ~/siegfried or c:\users\richardl\siegfried). Alternatively, you can provide a different file location as a flag when using the sieg executable.

### Signature file

You can also build your own signature file using the R2D2 tool (it talks to Droid, get it!... and, yes, a protocol droid would have been more appropriate but that name was already taken :().

To do this:

- install r2d2 (go get github.com/richardlehane/cmd/r2d2)

- get recent Droid signature and container files. These are available for download from this page: [http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/aboutapps/pronom/droid-signature-files.html](http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/aboutapps/pronom/droid-signature-files.html). If these aren't the same as the defaults in the R2D2 tool (use the r2d2 -defaults command to check), you will need to supply the names of your updated files with additional flags to the relevant R2D2 commands

- harvest Pronom reports with R2D2 (./r2d2 -harvest)

- run the R2D2 build command (./r2d2 -build)

## Changes
### Version 0.2 (26/03/2014)

- benchmarks (cmd/sieg/testdata)
- an Identifier type that controls the matching process and stops on best possible match (i.e. no longer require a full file scan for all files)
- name/extension matching
- a custom reader (pkg/core/siegreader)
- simplifications to the sieg command and signature file
- optimisations that have boosted performance (see cmd/sieg/testdata/bench_results.txt). But still too slow!

### Version 0.1 (28/02/2014)

First release. Parses PRONOM signatures and performs byte matching. Bare bones CLI. Glacially slow!

## Hacking

Have a peek at upcoming features, planned optimisations and known bugs on the [trello list](https://trello.com/b/ABXkGk6T/siegfried). Please get in touch if you'd like to take any of it on.
