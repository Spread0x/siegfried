# Siegfried

Siegfried is a signature-based file identification tool.

## Version

0.1

## Install

With go installed: 

go get github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/cmd/siegfried

go get github.com/richardlehane/siegfried/cmd/rd2d

Or:

Download this pre-built Win64 package <https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/48160346/Siegfried-0_1-Win64.zip>

Before using Siegfried, you must download current Pronom reports and generate a signature file.

To do this:

- Get Droid signature and container files. These are available for download from this page: http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/aboutapps/pronom/droid-signature-files.htm. If these aren't the same as the defaults in the r2d2 tool (use the r2d2 -defaults command to check), you will need to supply the names of your updated files with additional flags to the relevant R2D2 commands

- Harvest Pronom reports with the R2D2 tool (./r2d2 -harvest)

- Build a Siegfried signature file with the R2D2 build command (./r2d2 -build)

## Usage

### Command line

    ./siegfried file.ext
    ./siegfried /DIR

    ./r2d2 -harvest
    ./r2d2 -build 
    ./r2d2 -stats
    ./r2d2 -printdroid
    ./r2d2 -defaults

## TODO

### Version 0.2 (March 2014)

- begin optimising. e.g. replace stop the world, full buffer, recursive frame matching with goroutines, channels and limited buffers
- implement an Identifier type that controls the matching process and stops on best possible match (i.e. no longer require a full file scan for all files)
- name/extension matching

### Version 0.3 (April 2014)

- container matching (see github.com/richardlehane/mscfb)

### Version 0.4 (May 2014)

- server mode

### Version 0.5 (July 2014)

- HTML GUI

## Changes

### Version 0.1 (28/02/2014)

First release. Parses PRONOM signatures and performs byte matching. Bare bones CLI. Glacially slow!
