## Changes
### Version 0.4.1 (14/09/2014)
- sieg command line: descriptive output in YAML, including basis for matches
- optimisations inc. initial BOF loop before main matching loop

### Version 0.4 (24/08/2014)
- sieg command line changes: -version and -update flags now enabled
- over-the-wire updates of signature files from www.itforarchivists.com/siegfried

### Version 0.3 (19/08/2014)
- replaced ac matcher with wac matcher
- re-write of bytematcher code
- some benchmarks slower but fewer really poor edge cases (see cmd/sieg/testdata/bench_results.txt)... so a win!
- but still too slow!

### Version 0.2 (26/03/2014)

- benchmarks (cmd/sieg/testdata)
- an Identifier type that controls the matching process and stops on best possible match (i.e. no longer require a full file scan for all files)
- name/extension matching
- a custom reader (pkg/core/siegreader)
- simplifications to the sieg command and signature file
- optimisations that have boosted performance (see cmd/sieg/testdata/bench_results.txt). But still too slow!

### Version 0.1 (28/02/2014)

First release. Parses PRONOM signatures and performs byte matching. Bare bones CLI. Glacially slow!

## Hacking
